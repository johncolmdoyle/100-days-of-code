# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started working on AWS Honeycode, found a resouce that demonstrates importing and overwriting a table via AWS Lambda. Started the scaffolding of the Honeycode app, understanding how to relate to a table that will be getting overwritten and built logic around the UI to account for this.

**Thoughts:** The formulas are a lot more clunky than expected. Data import into Honeycode is a huge pain. Another thought being, does working on Honeycode count towards #100DaysOfCode ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯¯
